    As Tiruchirappalli is surrounded by a lot of temples, churches, mosques and picnic spots on all directions,
    there are few more places in Trichy, which are radically distinctive from the above-named sites.
    They are Amma Mandapam and Kaveri Bridge (Cauvery bridge) which stuns tourists and local population with its never ceasing beauty.
    The Amma mandapam is a typical ghat (a stairway leading down to a landing in the Kaveri River) located 2 km away in the opposite direction of Srirangam Sri Ranganathar Swamy temple. 
    The Amma Mandapam ghat is the home of numerous ceremonies and rituals.The holy water of Kaveri River is collected in a golden pot and carried by the temple elephant Andal.
    While the elephant is accompanied by mangala isai from nadaswaram and thavil (music from a wind and percussive instrument) all the way to Srirangam temple,
    it is a unique ceremonial kind of a scene to be delighted.
